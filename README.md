This is the source code for my portfolio available [here](https://konstantin-lukas.de).
This project was made with Next.js using the `app` router. The design for this Website
has been around since my apprenticeship at Zalando. For the original version I used vanilla
PHP. However, I've come a long way since then and decided to rewrite my website for TypeScript
and React using Next.js and migrate from my PHP hosting plan to a VPS.

Keep in mind that some things like styles were just copied over so a lot of the CSS
is not taking advantage of SCSS features like nesting.
